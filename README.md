Heart Disease Risk Analysis
# Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the UCI Heart Disease Dataset to identify major risk factors contributing to heart disease. Using visualizations, correlation analysis, outlier detection, and clustering (PCA + KMeans), the study provides meaningful insights that support early detection, prevention, and better healthcare decision-making.

# Objectives

Analyze patient health indicators such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type, and maximum heart rate.
Identify key risk factors influencing heart disease.
Visualize demographic trends (age groups, gender distribution) in relation to disease outcomes.
Perform correlation analysis to uncover relationships between features.
Apply PCA and KMeans clustering to group patients into low-risk and high-risk categories.

# Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Features: Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, ECG, Max Heart Rate, Exercise-Induced Angina, ST Depression, Slope, CA, Thal, Target (disease outcome).
Target Variable:
0 = No Heart Disease
1 = Heart Disease

# Methods & Techniques

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Descriptive Statistics & Distribution Analysis
Interactive Visualizations (Plotly & Seaborn)
Correlation Heatmaps
Outlier Detection (IQR method)
Clustering (PCA + KMeans)

# Key Findings

Risk of heart disease increases significantly after age 50, especially in males.
Chest pain type and maximum heart rate show strong correlation with disease outcome.
Very high cholesterol values indicate higher risk but overall correlation is weak.
Clustering separated patients into low-risk vs high-risk groups effectively.

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates that data-driven analysis can uncover important health insights. By identifying key risk factors and grouping patients by risk level, such analysis can support early diagnosis, prevention, and healthcare decision-making.
